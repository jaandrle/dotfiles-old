## My [Vifm](https://vifm.info/) file manager config
Cross-platform (Windows/Ubuntu) and cross-version config.

## Tips
- Non-blocking file manipulations (see [on 22 Feb 2020](https://github.com/vifm/vifm/issues/511#issuecomment-589889424)):
> :copy &, :move & or :put &. You'll sill get the progress at the bottom and can stop the copying from :jobs menu (by pressing dd).
