## Visual Studio Code
In fact, I use _Visual Studio Code Settings Sync_ extension (gist [jaandrle](https://gist.github.com/jaandrle)/__cloudSettings__) for saving/syncing my settings.

So, there are just some backups and notes.

### [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
I am using this plugin for emulating Vim behaviour (_„The best from both worlds”_).

Some vim tips can be found [../vim](../vim/).
